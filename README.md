Multi-Cloud VPC Deployment Module
Overview
This module is designed to streamline the deployment of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) across multiple cloud service providers, specifically targeting AWS and Azure. Utilizing a modular approach, the codebase facilitates the deployment of three VPCs to each designated region within the cloud providers. For AWS, the targeted region is eu-west-2 (London), and for Azure, it is North Europe (Ireland). This strategic deployment enhances network isolation, security, and regional redundancy, aligning with best practices for high availability and disaster recovery planning in multicloud networking architectures.

Features
Automated VPC Deployment: Automates the creation of three VPCs in both AWS eu-west-2 and Azure North Europe regions, ensuring consistency and reducing manual configuration errors.
Modular Design: The code is structured modularly, allowing for easy customization and scalability. Users can adjust parameters such as the number of VPCs or targeted regions without extensive code modifications.
High Availability Configuration: Prepares the network infrastructure for high availability applications, supporting multicloud strategies that leverage the strengths of both AWS and Azure platforms.
Security and Isolation: Each VPC is configured with security groups and network ACLs to ensure a secure and isolated environment for application deployment.
Architecture Diagram
Below is a diagram illustrating the deployment of VPCs across AWS and Azure in the specified regions. This visual representation aids in understanding the overall network topology and the interconnectivity between the cloud environments.

Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure you have the AWS CLI and Azure CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials.
Configuration: Review the config.json file to adjust any default settings such as VPC names, CIDR blocks, and the number of subnets.
Deployment: Run the deployment script with the necessary permissions. For detailed instructions, see the Deployment.md guide.
Verification: After deployment, verify the VPC configurations using the AWS Management Console and Azure Portal.
